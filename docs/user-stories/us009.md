# User Story: Game Loop & Server Browser

**ID:** US009  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** Large  
**Epic:** Core Gameplay

## Story

As a player, I want to seamlessly progress through the game's core loop—from server browser to map and back—so that I can enjoy a continuous and engaging gameplay experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Players start by connecting to the server browser
- [ ] In the server browser, players can customize cosmetics, form parties, and join servers
- [ ] Players can join servers directly via the server browser
- [ ] Once a server is joined, players are transported to the map with a preparation phase
- [ ] Map consists of defending points of interest across waves (3 POIs × 3 waves = 9 waves total)
- [ ] After completing or failing a map, players have 15 seconds to decide: they may disconnect to return to the server browser with rewards (scrap, data, XP), or stay on the server to continue to the next map in rotation.
- [ ] Rewards are automatically granted and visible in the UI
- [ ] Players can immediately join another server or continue customization in the server browser
- [ ] Progression (level, unlocks, currency) persists across sessions

## Notes

- Upgrades are non‑persistent across maps (except cosmetics). Skills are map‑based and reset each map.
- Server browser should show server details (player count, ping, map) and allow filtering
- Transition between server browser and map should be smooth with loading screens or animations
- Reward presentation should feel satisfying (e.g., loot box animation, currency pop‑ups)

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement server connection and session management
- [ ] Build server browser with party support
- [ ] Create seamless transition flow between server browser and map
- [ ] Design reward distribution and UI feedback
- [ ] Ensure persistence of progression across game sessions
