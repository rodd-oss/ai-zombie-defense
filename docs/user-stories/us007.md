# User Story: Enemy AI Behavior

**ID:** US007  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** Large  
**Epic:** Core Gameplay

## Story

As a player, I want enemies to behave intelligently and pose varied threats so that combat remains challenging and engaging.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enemies pathfind to the active point of interest (POI), attacking players who block their path
- [ ] Special enemies may prioritize players over the POI based on behavior (e.g., vampire targets low‑health players)
- [ ] Enemy types have distinct behaviors:
  - Walker: slow movement, high health, basic melee attacks
  - Runner: fast movement, low health, aggressive melee attacks
  - Tank: very high health, heavy melee damage, slow but hard‑hitting
  - Spitter: stays at range, spits acid that damages over time or slows
  - Vampire: drains player health on hit, can teleport short distances to close gaps
- [ ] Enemies react to player actions (e.g., change target when damaged, flee from grenades)
- [ ] Enemy spawns are balanced across waves and scale with player count and difficulty
- [ ] Enemies have visual and audio cues for attacks and special abilities

## Notes

- AI should be performant even with large numbers of enemies on screen
- Special enemy abilities should be telegraphed to give players time to react
- Pathfinding should handle dynamic obstacles (player‑placed buildings, other enemies)

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement pathfinding system (e.g., NavMesh, grid‑based)
- [ ] Design AI behavior trees/state machines for each enemy type
- [ ] Create targeting logic (prioritize players vs POI)
- [ ] Implement enemy spawning and wave composition logic
- [ ] Add visual/audio feedback for enemy actions
