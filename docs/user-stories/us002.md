## Story

As a player, I want to earn and spend different types of currency and loot so that I can purchase temporary upgrades, consumables, and cosmetics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scrap currency is earned from killing enemies and is used for in‑map purchases (weapons, ammo, buildings, temporary skill upgrades)
- [ ] Data currency is earned from completing maps and is used for cosmetic unlocks only
- [ ] Special enemies drop cosmetic items or weapon skins (persistent)
- [ ] In‑map shop sells consumables, temporary gear, temporary skill upgrades
- [ ] Permanent cosmetics are purchased from a main menu store using Data currency
- [ ] Players can view their currency balances in the UI
- [ ] Currency and cosmetic items are persisted between game sessions; skill upgrades are temporary

## Notes

- Scrap should be relatively abundant, Data should be rare and valuable
- Loot drops should feel rewarding but not game‑breaking
- Shop prices need to be balanced with earning rates
- Only cosmetics and skins persist between sessions; skill upgrades are temporary

## Tasks

- [ ] Design currency earning rates and drop tables
- [ ] Implement shop UI and backend transaction logic
- [ ] Create loot tables for special enemies
- [ ] Implement currency persistence and UI display
