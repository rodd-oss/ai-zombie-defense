# User Story: Player Progression System

**ID:** US001  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** Large  
**Epic:** Progression

## Story

As a player, I want to earn skill points and scrap during a map to purchase temporary skill upgrades, weapons, and buildings for that match, while unlocking persistent cosmetics across sessions, so that I can adapt my strategy each game and showcase my long-term achievements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Players earn scrap and skill points from killing enemies and completing waves during a map
- [ ] Skill points can be spent on temporary skill upgrades (e.g., +10% health, faster reload, building durability) that last only for the current map
- [ ] Weapons and defensive structures are purchased with scrap during a map, not unlocked via player level
- [ ] Skill points and upgrades reset at the end of each map
- [ ] Cosmetic items (skins, emotes, banners) are unlocked permanently via achievements, challenges, or prestige system
- [ ] Persistent progression includes only cosmetics and prestige levels; no persistent skill points or level-based unlocks

## Notes

- Skill tree offers meaningful choices that affect playstyle within a single map
- Prestige system provides cosmetic rewards without gameplay advantages
- Progression reset each map encourages experimentation and adaptation
- Aligns with server‑browser model: players join servers directly; no matchmaking required

## Tasks

- [ ] Design currency economy and upgrade costs per map
- [ ] Implement in-map skill purchase UI and backend logic
- [ ] Create weapon and building purchase tables (available from start)
- [ ] Implement cosmetic unlock system with persistent storage
- [ ] Implement prestige system for cosmetic rewards
