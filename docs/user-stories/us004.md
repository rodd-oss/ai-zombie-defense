## Story

As a player, I want to engage in satisfying combat using a variety of weapons and abilities so that I can defeat enemies and survive waves.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multiple weapon types are available:
  - Ranged: assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols
  - Melee: bat, axe, knife (fast, low damage)
  - Throwables: grenades, molotovs, flashbangs
- [ ] Players have health and optional armor; damage reduces health/armor
- [ ] Healing items (medkits) restore health over time when used
- [ ] Weapons have distinct stats (damage, rate of fire, accuracy, reload time)
- [ ] Ammunition is limited and must be managed; ammo can be purchased or found
- [ ] Enemy types include:
  - Walker: slow, high health
  - Runner: fast, low health
  - Tank: very high health, deals heavy damage
  - Spitter: ranged acid attack
  - Vampire: drains player health, can teleport short distances
- [ ] Combat feedback includes hit markers, damage numbers, and visual/audio effects

## Notes

- Weapon feel (recoil, sound, animation) is crucial for player satisfaction
- Healing items should have a cooldown or limited inventory to prevent spam
- Armor should provide meaningful damage reduction but not make players invincible

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement weapon system with stats and animations
- [ ] Create health/armor system and damage calculation
- [ ] Design healing items and inventory management
- [ ] Implement enemy types with distinct behaviors and visuals
- [ ] Add combat feedback (UI, VFX, SFX)
