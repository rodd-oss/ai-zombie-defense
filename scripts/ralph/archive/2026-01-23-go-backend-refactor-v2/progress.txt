## Codebase Patterns
- Unified Go module at `apps/backend-api` using module name `ai-zombie-defense/backend-api`.
- Database logic located in `apps/backend-api/db`.
- Internal server packages (gateway, middleware, services) located in `apps/backend-api/internal`.
- Always verify with `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` from the `apps/backend-api` directory.
