## 2026-01-22 10:51 UTC - US-001
- Converted ERD diagram to SQL migration files for all database tables
- Created 16 migration files in packages/go/db/migrations/ with proper foreign key constraints and indexes
- Files changed: packages/go/db/migrations/*.sql, scripts/ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Database schema is defined in docs/c4/containers/database-erd.puml as PlantUML
  - SQLite does not support ENUM types; use CHECK constraints with IN list
  - Use TEXT for timestamps with ISO 8601 format (strftime)
  - Foreign key indexes are not automatically created; need explicit CREATE INDEX
  - Naming convention: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_table_name.sql for goose migrations
