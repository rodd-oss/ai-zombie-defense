## Fri Jan 23 14:14:32 MSK 2026 - US-001
- Moved database SQL files and migrations to flatten the app structure.
- Files changed:
  - Moved apps/backend-api/db/migrations/* to apps/backend-api/migrations/
  - Moved apps/backend-api/db/queries/* to apps/backend-api/internal/db/sql/queries/
  - Moved apps/backend-api/db/schema/* to apps/backend-api/internal/db/sql/schema/
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When flattening the structure, ensure that any tools (like sqlc or goose) that depend on these paths are updated in subsequent steps.
  - Using `mkdir -p` ensures that the destination path exists before moving, avoiding file-into-file move errors.
