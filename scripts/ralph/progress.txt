## Codebase Patterns
- Use `internal/db` as the primary entry point for database operations.
- `internal/db/db.go` provides aliases for all generated `sqlc` types to simplify imports.
- `internal/db/types` contains custom types (like `Timestamp`) used in database models.

## Fri Jan 23 14:50:23 MSK 2026 - US-003
- Relocated database utilities logic and tests to internal/db.
- Created internal/db/db.go with convenience aliases for generated types and Queries.
- Updated cmd/server/main.go and db/cmd/migrate/main.go to use the new internal/db package.
- Verified that all tests in internal/db pass.
- Files changed:
  - apps/backend-api/internal/db/db.go (created)
  - apps/backend-api/cmd/server/main.go
  - apps/backend-api/db/cmd/migrate/main.go
  - apps/backend-api/internal/db/AGENTS.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project is moving towards a flatter structure where database logic is consolidated in internal/db.
  - Avoid using the old db/pkg package; it's scheduled for removal in US-005.
  - The internal/db package now acts as a facade for the generated sqlc code.

## Fri Jan 23 15:15:23 MSK 2026 - US-004
- Integrated migration subcommand into the main server binary in `apps/backend-api/cmd/server/main.go`.
- Implemented `up`, `down`, and `status` subcommands for the `migrate` command.
- Verified subcommand functionality with `go run cmd/server/main.go migrate status`.
- Updated `apps/backend-api/AGENTS.md` with migration subcommand documentation.
- Files changed:
  - apps/backend-api/cmd/server/main.go
  - apps/backend-api/AGENTS.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Subcommand parsing in `main.go` uses simple `os.Args` switching.
  - The `migrate` subcommand provides a convenient way to manage database schema without a separate binary.
  - Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set (even if dummy) when running the server binary for migrations, as config loading requires it.
