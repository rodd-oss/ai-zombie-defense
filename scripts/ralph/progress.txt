## 2026-01-22 10:51 UTC - US-001
- Converted ERD diagram to SQL migration files for all database tables
- Created 16 migration files in packages/go/db/migrations/ with proper foreign key constraints and indexes
- Files changed: packages/go/db/migrations/*.sql, scripts/ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Database schema is defined in docs/c4/containers/database-erd.puml as PlantUML
  - SQLite does not support ENUM types; use CHECK constraints with IN list
  - Use TEXT for timestamps with ISO 8601 format (strftime)
  - Foreign key indexes are not automatically created; need explicit CREATE INDEX
  - Naming convention: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_table_name.sql for goose migrations

## 2026-01-22 14:21 UTC - US-002
- Set up sqlc configuration and generated Go models for all database tables
- Files changed: packages/go/db/sqlc.yaml, packages/go/db/schema/schema.sql, packages/go/db/queries/player.sql, packages/go/db/generated/*, packages/go/db/go.mod, packages/go/db/go.sum, go.work
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SQLite does not support ENUM types; use CHECK constraints with IN list
  - Timestamp columns are TEXT with ISO 8601 format; use column-specific overrides in sqlc.yaml to map to time.Time
  - Nullable timestamp columns need `pointer: true` in sqlc overrides to generate *time.Time
  - The go.work file must include module paths for go vet to work; currently only includes packages/go/db
  - Use sqlc generate with at least one query file referencing tables; placeholder SELECT 1 is insufficient
