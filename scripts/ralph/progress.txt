## Codebase Patterns
- Use 'ai-zombie-defense/server/internal/services' for service interfaces and implementations.
- Each service module should have its own package under internal/services.
- Handlers should depend on service interfaces rather than concrete implementations (ongoing).

## 2026-01-23 12:25:01 - US-001
- Defined service interfaces and directory structure for the modular monolith refactor.
- Created internal/services directory with sub-packages for each service.
- Implemented Service interfaces for: auth, account, progression, match, server, social, leaderboard, and loot.
- Files changed:
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/auth/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/account/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/progression/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/match/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/server/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/social/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/leaderboard/service.go
  - packages/go/server/internal/services/loot/service.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase currently uses a large "god service" in pkg/auth/auth.go that needs to be broken down.
  - New service interfaces should be placed in internal/services to ensure isolation.
  - Workspace uses 'ai-zombie-defense/server' as the base module for internal packages.
