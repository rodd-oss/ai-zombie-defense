## Codebase Patterns
- Move generated SQLC code to `internal/db` and export via type aliases in the root `db` package to keep the module API clean while hiding implementation details.
- Always run `go vet ./...` and `go build ./...` when changing package structures in Go.
- Use `APIGateway` as the central entry point for routing and server lifecycle management (Start/Shutdown).
- Middleware should be kept in `internal/middleware` to hide internal logic while providing necessary Fiber handlers for routing.

- Refactored Database Package structure by moving SQLC generated files to `internal/db/`.
- Updated `sqlc.yaml` to reflect the new output directory.
- Created a facade in the root `db` package to export types and functions from `internal/db`.
- Removed the obsolete `generated_backup` directory.
- Files changed:
    - `packages/go/db/sqlc.yaml`
    - `packages/go/db/db.go`
    - `packages/go/db/models.go`
    - `packages/go/db/*.sql.go`
    - `packages/go/db/AGENTS.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use type aliases (`type T = internal.T`) in a parent package to selectively export types from an `internal` subpackage.
  - Functions must be wrapped (`func F() { return internal.F() }`) as they cannot be aliased like types.

- Consolidated `APIGateway` by merging logic from the obsolete `server` package.
- Deleted `packages/go/server/pkg/server/` and updated all references to use `gateway.APIGateway`.
- Updated `APIGateway` to handle its own `Start` and `Shutdown` methods, orchestrating Fiber's lifecycle.
- Moved route registration to `APIGateway` to centralize initial entry point logic.
- Verified server starts and `/health` endpoint works correctly.
- Files changed:
    - `packages/go/server/internal/api/gateway/gateway.go`
    - `packages/go/server/cmd/server/main.go`
    - `packages/go/server/pkg/handlers/servers_test.go`
    - `packages/go/server/pkg/handlers/account_test.go`
    - `packages/go/server/AGENTS.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `APIGateway` should be the owner of the `fiber.App` lifecycle in the modular monolith.
  - When deleting a package, check for integration tests that might depend on it for bootstrapping the app.
  - Mocking or using the new gateway in tests is straightforward if it exposes the underlying router/app.

- Migrated all middleware from `pkg/middleware/` to `internal/middleware/`.
- Updated all import references in `gateway.go`, `handlers/`, and tests to the new location.
- Verified typecheck and middleware tests pass.
- Removed the now-empty `pkg/middleware/` directory.
- Files changed:
    - `packages/go/server/internal/middleware/*.go`
    - `packages/go/server/internal/api/gateway/gateway.go`
    - `packages/go/server/pkg/handlers/*.go`
    - `packages/go/server/AGENTS.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Moving middleware to `internal` is a key step in encapsulation for the modular monolith.
  - All handlers that use `c.Locals` should have helper functions in the middleware package to ensure type-safe access to context values.
