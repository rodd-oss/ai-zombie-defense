## Codebase Patterns
- Unified Backend: Move all Go logic to `apps/backend-api` and update `go.work`.

## 2026-01-23 14:00 - US-001
- Created `apps/backend-api` directory.
- Initialized `go.mod` with `ai-zombie-defense/backend-api`.
- Updated `go.work` to use `./apps/backend-api` and removed old Go packages.
- Files changed: `apps/backend-api/go.mod`, `go.work`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `go.work` needs to be updated manually when moving packages out of their original directories if they were part of the workspace.
  - Initializing an empty module will cause `go build ./...` to warn about no packages, which is expected.
