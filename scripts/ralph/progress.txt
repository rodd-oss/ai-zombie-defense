## Codebase Patterns
- Unified Backend: Move all Go logic to `apps/backend-api` and update `go.work`.

---

## 2026-01-23 14:00 - US-001
- Created `apps/backend-api` directory.
- Initialized `go.mod` with `ai-zombie-defense/backend-api`.
- Updated `go.work` to use `./apps/backend-api` and removed old Go packages.
- Files changed: `apps/backend-api/go.mod`, `go.work`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `go.work` needs to be updated manually when moving packages out of their original directories if they were part of the workspace.
  - Initializing an empty module will cause `go build ./...` to warn about no packages, which is expected.

## 2026-01-23 14:15 - US-002
- Migrated all database logic from `packages/go/db` to `apps/backend-api/db`.
- Updated `sqlc.yaml` relative paths and import overrides to use `ai-zombie-defense/backend-api/db`.
- Refactored all internal imports within the `db` package to use the new module path.
- Verified with `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, and `go test ./...` in `apps/backend-api/db`.
- Removed original files from `packages/go/db`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Global search and replace for `ai-zombie-defense/db` to `ai-zombie-defense/backend-api/db` is necessary when moving the package.
  - `sqlc.yaml` overrides often contain hardcoded import paths that must be updated.
  - `go mod tidy` in the new app directory will correctly pick up dependencies from the moved files.
